# Simple-Project-Management-Website-Mini-Project

My DBMS Project Management Site Work Mini Project
In this Repository, I had Uploaded simple Project Management Site just to show how it works.

User Interface is not so Good (Made with - HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, js, jQuery )but Backend is something to be noted.
You can see in the Output Folder.

A backend is made from Mainly Php and MySql.
Front Page Contains Simple UI and with Sign Up and Login Option in Navbar for Students as well as Faculty.
Sign Up for using their Project Management :)
Then Login - I kept Password of student and faculty as 111111 

After Student Login they See their Projects also they can add it or delete it.

Faculty can see projects of Students of their branch. They can also search for projects of students.
